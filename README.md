# Impostor-Deobfuscator
A deobfuscator for https://github.com/CSM-BlueRed/Impostor

# Usage:
Put the part of the obfuscated script that starts with 'Interpreter(b' into line 19.

Run the script (```python main.py```).

# If you get errors:

- Try the "fallback" mode (```python main.py fallback```) but it will look chunky.

- Try installing decompyle3 (https://github.com/rocky/python-decompile3)
